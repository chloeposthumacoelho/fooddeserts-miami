		<h1 id="heading">How are Indigenous People Affected?</h1>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A social issue which arises as a result of mass amounts of land being deforested to create 
		palm oil plantations is that indigenous people from tropical areas are losing their habitat. This loss of habitat 
		has occurred as indigenous people from areas, particularly in tropical areas throughout Asia, have homes in or near 
		the forests which are being deforested to make room for growing and developing palm oil. As presented by (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/book/9780981893693/palm-oil">Henson et al., 2012: 20</a>),
		this has created challenges that are growing between individuals who live in tropical areas and palm oil production companies, 
		due to “disputes over land ownership between plantation companies and native peoples.” The authors continue that the issue of 
		property ownership when it comes to tropical areas is a critical issue which respective governments have showed signs of working
		to rectify. They argue that laws have been introduced to try to protect vulnerable groups, however the laws are not strongly 
		implemented in practice, often due to “lack of resources” (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/book/9780981893693/palm-oil">Henson et al., 2012: 20</a>). It is therefore alarming that the 
		production of palm oil not only results in detrimental environmental consequences, but also social consequences which are pushing
		indigenous peoples out of their homes.</p>

		<h1 id="heading">Conflict</h1>
		<br>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of indigenous people largely suffering when at conflict with large palm oil production companies is a
		particular issue in Indonesia and Cambodia. As presented by (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508511_Conflict_over_forests_and_land_in_Asia">Yasmi et al., 2010:12</a>), the residents of these 
		tropical areas are “rarely able to defend their rights and make their voices heard ... they often end up 
		losing in the battle over forests and land.” Furthermore, “the imbalance in power often means that those most 
		affected by conflict are not able to address it independently of external support” (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508511_Conflict_over_forests_and_land_in_Asia">Yasmi et al., 2010: 12</a>). 
		The social issue of indigenous people being displaced from their natural homes and habitats with no support or
		compensation given is a critical issue associated with palm oil which is rarely presented in mainstream media 
		debates regarding palm oil. However, it is such a critical issue and social consequence of consumers buying products
		with unsustainable palm oil and it needs to be presented to the general public to raise awareness.</p>
