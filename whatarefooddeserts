		<h1 id="heading">What Should we Do?</h1>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of palm oil is associated with devastating consequences, 
		including <a href="MassDeforestation.html">mass deforestation</a>, <a href="CarbonPollution.html">carbon pollution</a>, the loss of habitat for
		<a href="IndigineousPeople.html">indigenous peoples</a> and the <A href="RareAnimalsDying.html">death of endangered animals</a>. The colossal damage that the production
		of the palm plant has had on environmental and social spaces, particularly in Southeast Asia, has
		resulted in consumers pledging to stop buying products that contain palm oil. However, is the complete
		eradication of palm oil the best solution? 
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 id="heading">Complete Eradication is not the Answer</h1>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant issue with palm oil is that despite the highly detrimental 
		consequences that present themselves as a result of palm oil production, the palm
		fruit is still one of the most effective crops. This is evidenced
		in the fact that the palm plant has a high yield - producing more oil while 
		taking up less land than other forms of vegetable oil (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44563180">source</a>). 
		Further, if palm oil were to be replaced by growing other forms of crops such as "soy" or "sunflower seed oil", "up to
		nine times" the space of land would be required that is required to grow palm oil (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44563180">source</a>).</p>
		<br>
		<h1 id="heading">The Solution? - Sustainable Palm Oil</h1>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaching a solution in the palm oil debate is challenging due to the effectiveness of palm oil as a high yielding 
		crop.  However, a recommended starting-point is to work towards changing our consumer habits to support sustainable palm oil, as explained in the following video: </p>

			Take 5 minutes to find out how the RSPO works and why WWF supports it as one strategy to help reduce deforestation and biodiversity loss in the tropics" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lev1mnonUM">source</a>).</b></p>

		<h1 id="heading">Why We Should Support Sustainable Palm Oil </h1>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		<h3 style="color:green">1)	Palm oil production provides employment opportunities</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the widespread production of palm oil in areas such as Indonesia and Malaysia, palm oil 
		production provides a consistent income and employment opportunities to local groups. Furthermore, as palm oil is 
		grown in rural areas due to the mass amount of land required to grow the crop, jobs are created in rural areas where 
		it is otherwise difficult to find employment opportunities. As discussed by (<a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-06-palm-oil-responsible-global-deforestation.html#jCp">Baron et al., 2017</a>) – “When properly 
		developed and managed, palm oil plantations can play an important role in improving likelihoods and eradicating 
		poverty in the tropics’ rural areas.” </p>
		
		<p>The following video from WWF shares the change in quality of life a palm oil worker has experienced due to his job: </p>

			<p><b>"Certified sustainable palm oil cannot be grown in place of primary forest or in important conservation areas. Growers have to use the best growing practices to keep soil and water supplies healthy, and to reduce pollution and carbon emissions. They also need to pay a decent wage and respect the rights of workers and communities." (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BRGj0DwYwA">source</a>).</b></p> 
		</center>
						
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3 style="color:green">2)	When grown sustainably, palm oil takes up less land than other crops</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The African palm plant is a highly effective crop and requires much less land to yield the same amount of oil as other sources of vegetable oil. If palm oil is grown in sustainable environments where wildlife and indigenous communities are respected, the production of palm oil can be very effective and even environmentally friendly. 
		<br>
		<p>An example of a leader in sustainable palm oil production is the brand ‘Earth Choice’. The brand is continuing to improve palm oil production conditions in Malaysia by not contributing to any further deforestation. Earth Choice products only use oil from palm oil plantations that are more than one-hundred and thirty years old – meaning there is no contribution towards further deforestation. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl8zB6dNzJk">Source</a>).</p>

		<p>The following video from Chester Zoo further highlights the impact of sustainable palm oil:</p>

			<p><b>"As part of the Sustainable Palm Oil Challenge, this an animation that takes you through the whole journey of how palm oil is grown, processed and used to make products that we buy.  Whether you want to focus on the plantation owner, the manufacturer, or the consumer - each part of the supply chain is shown here." (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH23_j1T1Ek">source</a>).</b></p> 
		</center>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3 style="color:green">3) By-products of palm oil are beneficial</h3>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When consumers buy products that contain sustainable palm oil, they are supporting the environmental benefit of palm 
		oil by-product recycling. As presented by (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780981893693500113">Hashim et al., 2012: 242</a>): “Among the new developments in the oil palm milling industry are the 
		rising interests in environmental sustainability. Waste materials generated from the milling processes are now being further examined for 
		conversion into value-added co-products.” Examples of by-products generated from sustainable palm oil production include “fuel for additional 
		energy and steam generation”, “biofuels” and “fertiliser” (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780981893693500113">Hashim et al., 2012: 244</a>).</p>
