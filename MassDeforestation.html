            <br>
	            <p>
				 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deforestation associated with palm oil is a significant and critical issue, largely due to the mass amount of land that is being deforested to grow the African oil palm. Large areas of land are required to grow the necessary crops to produce palm oil, and the severity of this land conversion has been further fuelled by the recent global demand for palm oil. As outlined by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780981893693500046">(Henson et al., 2012: 20)</a>, the "rapid expansion" of "palm oil cultivation" is of particular significance as it most often tropical areas which are deforested to grow the crop, as palm plants are originally from tropical areas in Africa. As it is largely tropical areas which are affected by the boom in palm oil production, “much of this expansion has come at the expense of species-rich and carbon-rich tropical forests” <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159668"> (Vijay et al., 2016: online)</a>. The consequences of mass deforestation of tropical lands are critical - not only affecting the relative sites themselves, but the general planet. Some consequences of tropical land loss include the loss of diverse wildlife habitats, "carbon stores", and the contribution towards "improper disposal of mill wastes", "contamination of rivers due to leaching of nutrients and pesticides" and the "emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that underpin climate change" <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780981893693500046">(Henson et al., 2012: 20)</a>. As it is the tropical areas which largely help to control and reduce greenhouse gases - if these sources of pollution-control are being drastically reduced, the rest of the world is inevitably affected by the mass deforestation.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken from the BBC Podcast ‘<a href="https://soundcloud.com/bbcr4costingtheearth/costearth-palm-oil-palm-off-03">Costing The Earth</a>’, this episode highlights the critical nature of the issue of mass deforestation and places it into a real-world context. While it is important to discuss the current landscape of deforestation through text and the use of scholarly articles, this episode reports the issue from the perspective of those living in Indonesia. This is important to acknowledge the impact of palm oil production is having on local residents and farmers, where land is continually being burned down to produce palm oil:</p>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas which have most recently been affected by palm oil deforestation are Southeast Asian tropical forests <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">(Khatun et al., 2017: 611)</a> and this is resulting in significant detrimental effects on the diverse and valuable biodiversity of these areas. As outlined by <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/forests/deforestation_fronts/deforestation_in_borneo_and_sumatra/">WWF</a>, palm oil deforestation is the leading cause of deforestation in Borneo and the destructive conversion of land due to palm oil is growing at an alarming rate. Throughout Indonesia, palm oil growth has risen from "600,000 hectares in 1985 to over 6 million hectares by 2007". <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/forests/deforestation_fronts/deforestation_in_borneo_and_sumatra/">(WWF, 2019: Online)</a>

Further, <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">(Khatun et al., 2017: 611)</a> present that in Sumatra, “oil palm plantations result in a significant reduction in biodiversity if plantations replace natural forests, secondary forests, agro-forests, or even degraded forests and scrubby unplanted areas.”</p>

            <h1 id="heading"><b>In Summary</b></h1>
            <br>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue, in summary, is that growing palm oil demands large amounts of mass land to be suitable for palm production. If land is not already suitable for palm production, deforestation is used to prepare the land - often tropical land, due to the palm plant originating from tropical areas in Africa. The result of tropical areas being converted to sites of palm production is that diverse and valuable land habitats are lost, trees which regulate CO2 for the planet are greatly reduced, and rivers are polluted - spreading the effects further than the just the original palm oil production site. </p>
