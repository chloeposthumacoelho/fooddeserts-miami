		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A food desert, according to healthline's article  <A href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/food-deserts">what are food deserts? all you need to know</a> is an area, normally rural or low income, which holds "communities that have poor access to healthy, affordable foods"
		it is a prevalent issue in Miami. Below is a video which gives insight into the issue of food deserts, as well as an explanation of how common of an issue it is: </p>

		</center>
		<br>
		<p>With lack of healthy options being nearby and nutritious food options being scarce, these communities are vulnerable to health issues which are not seen in other communities which may have access to fresh grocers and supermarket chains, such as Publix or Trader Joe's.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location matters, quite simply- and it has an impact on whether people can access good food options or not, affecting health and leading to inequality</a>.
		Such damage associated with the growth of palm has led the oil to be named “cruel oil or green gold” as “the oil palm industry 
		(planting and milling) has a devastating impact on the environment and ecosystems” (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">Khatun et al., 2017: 608</a>).
		In short, the production of palm oil requires large amounts of land to be deforested – leading to habitat loss, conflict within indigenous 
		communities, death of rare animals, and carbon pollution due to ‘slash and burn’ deforestation techniques (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">Khatun et al., 2017: 608</a>). 
		The various ethical consequences associated with the production of palm oil are discussed in more detail throughout this essay, including - <a href="CarbonPollution.html">carbon pollution</a>, <a href="MassDeforestation.html">mass deforestation</a>,
		<a href="RareAnimalsDying.html">death of rare animals</a> and <a href="IndigineousPeople.html">loss of habitat for indigenous communities</a>.</p>
