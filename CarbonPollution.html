		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass deforestation associated with palm oil production is not only reducing valuable wildlife and biodiversity in tropical areas, it is also resulting in a significant increase in carbon dioxide pollution throughout Southeast Asia, with the effects having the potential to spread worldwide.  Palm oil's contribution to carbon pollution is evidenced by the deforestation technique which is popularly employed, known as 
		"slash and burn" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BRGj0DwYwA">WWF, 2011</a>). Slash and burn techniques use fire as a means to quickly clear large amounts of land, as evidenced in the video below:</p>

        </div>
		</center>
		<br>
		
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slash and burn techniques contribute to carbon pollution in their relative areas due to the burning of large amounts of land producing thick and damaging smoke into the atmosphere which impacts on local 
		populations of humans and wildlife. The smoke pollution caused by palm oil deforestation also impacts areas worldwide by significantly contributing to the global production of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.
		As noted in (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159668">Vijay et al., 2016</a>)'s study on palm oil deforestation in tropical areas, the “annual carbon emissions from gross tropical deforestation” result in “nearly 10% of the global total of anthropogenic 
		greenhouse gas emissions.” With palm oil deforestation detrimentally impacting local and worldwide communities, the issue of palm oil is highly important and requires consumers to take action in order to work 
		towards reducing the production of palm oil.</p>
