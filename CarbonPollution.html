		<h1 id="heading">What Causes Carbon Pollution?</h1>
		
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass deforestation associated with palm oil production is not only reducing valuable wildlife and biodiversity in tropical areas, it is also resulting in a significant increase in carbon dioxide pollution throughout Southeast Asia, with the effects having the potential to spread worldwide.  Palm oil's contribution to carbon pollution is evidenced by the deforestation technique which is popularly employed, known as 
		"slash and burn" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BRGj0DwYwA">WWF, 2011</a>). Slash and burn techniques use fire as a means to quickly clear large amounts of land, as evidenced in the video below:</p>

        </div>
		</center>
		<br>
		
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slash and burn techniques contribute to carbon pollution in their relative areas due to the burning of large amounts of land producing thick and damaging smoke into the atmosphere which impacts on local 
		populations of humans and wildlife. The smoke pollution caused by palm oil deforestation also impacts areas worldwide by significantly contributing to the global production of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.
		As noted in (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159668">Vijay et al., 2016</a>)'s study on palm oil deforestation in tropical areas, the “annual carbon emissions from gross tropical deforestation” result in “nearly 10% of the global total of anthropogenic 
		greenhouse gas emissions.” With palm oil deforestation detrimentally impacting local and worldwide communities, the issue of palm oil is highly important and requires consumers to take action in order to work 
		towards reducing the production of palm oil.</p>

		<h1 id="heading">Where is this Carbon Pollution Coming From?</h1>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With palm oil predominantly being grown in tropical environments due to the crop being of tropical African origin, the majority of areas which are employing slash and burn 
		techniques and generating carbon dioxide pollution are tropical Southeast Asian areas. With Indonesia being the world's largest exporter of palm oil by producing 33.4 million 
		tonnes of palm oil in 2015 (<a href="https://greenpalm.org/about-palm-oil/where-is-palm-oil-grown-2">GreenPalm, 2016</a>) Indonesia is unfortunately being negatively impacted by the production of palm oil in order to meet consumer demand. The impact of carbon 
		pollution on Kalimantan forests is discussed throughout (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1702">Carlson et al., 2012</a>)'s study which is the first of its kind to produce “high-resolution carbon flux estimates from Kalimantan 
		plantations” using “Landsat satellite analyses” (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1702">Carlson et al., 2012: 283</a>) with results showing that “more than 75% of Indonesia’s CO2-equivalent emissions … are attributed to land cover 
		change” (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1702">Carlson et al., 2012: 285</a>). The negative impact of palm oil production and carbon dioxide pollution is further increased when met with slash and burn techniques, with the authors 
		presenting that “If plantations apply fire to clear peatlands … carbon emissions increase 24% above the non-fire scenario” (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1702">Carlson et al., 2012: 285</a>). To place
		these points in the context of real life, below is a video which highlights the impact of slash and burn techniques on Sumatra:

		<p>With palm oil not only vastly eradicating mass amounts of valuable land, but also producing high amounts of dangerous carbon pollution, it is a crop which is highly 
		detrimental to wildlife, the environment, and individuals living nearby to areas which grow palm oil. </p>

   <h1 id="heading">Conclusion and Image Gallery</h1>
   <br>
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With slash and burn techniques often chosen as they are the most effective at destroying mass amounts of land quickly, the environmental concerns of deforestation 
   are escalated further. Using fire to destroy forests releases carbon dioxide into the air due to the burning of trees, plants, and wildlife. Furthermore, the smoke pollution 
   alone from the fire is greatly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in countries in Southeast Asia.</p>
	<br>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section, the general issue of why carbon pollution is produced and the impact carbon pollution has on the environment has been discussed. Mass deforestation of valuable tropical land, often using highly pollutive techniques, 
	is not the only issue at hand in the palm oil debate. In the <a href="IndigineousPeople.html">next section</a>, the social effects of deforestation will be discussed.</p>
