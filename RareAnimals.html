		<h1 id="heading">Introduction</h1>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably, the most discussed angle of the palm oil debate is the impact of palm oil production on rare 
		animals (claim), evidenced in the growing popularity of campaigns, such as Iceland's viral 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdpspllWI2o">Christmas advert</a>(reason). The widespread 
		awareness that has been raised as a result of consumers learning about the what palm oil is and the 
		impact it has on the environment has been highly beneficial to the palm oil debate - evidenced with the 
		discussion being brought to mainstream media and social media: both highly accessible platforms for 
		consumers to be educated. While the media attention that has been brought to the palm oil debate has 
		been highly beneficial in starting the debate and engaging consumers with the emotional side of palm 
		oil production, there are very few sources which fully discuss the impact of palm oil production on 
		animals in an online multimedia format. This section of this multimedia essay shall outline what animals 
		are affected and how they are affected - highlighting the importance of consumers taking steps to reduce 
		their support of palm oil.  </p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 id="heading">What Animals are Affected?</h1>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consistent theme with all areas of the palm oil debate is that it is not only the 
		issue of wildlife being destroyed, but the wildlife that is being destroyed is highly valuable. This theme 
		also extends to the impact palm oil production has on animals as it is mainly rare animals which suffer 
		the most. As highlighted by <a href="https://www.theorangutanproject.org.uk/about-orangutans/palm-oil/">The Orangutan Project</a>,
		the animals which are most affected in Indonesia include "the world's most unique and iconic endangered wildlife
		such as the orangutan, elephant and tiger" (<a href="https://www.theorangutanproject.org.uk/about-orangutans/palm-oil/">The 
		Orangutan Project, 2016</a>). To experience the severity of the effect palm oil is having on rare animals, 
		please watch this video:</p>

		</center>
		<br>
		<p>Animals are impacted by palm oil production due to the deforestation required to grow and maintain 
		the crop. For orangutans, death is likely due to production companies eradicating large amounts of trees - 
		where orangutans live. Animals such as elephants and tigers are impacted due to the harsh deforestation 
		processes often using fire (as discussed in '<a href="CarbonPollution.html">Carbon Pollution</a>') and for 
		animals that survive, life is much more difficult due to their homes and natural food sources being destroyed
		and replaced with rows of palm crops.</p>

		<br>
		<h3 style=color:orange><b>Orangutans</b></h3>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borneo in particular is a Southeast Asian island in which orangutans have significantly suffered as a result of palm oil production, 
		largely due to Indonesia being the world’s biggest exporter of palm oil. Presented by (<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30086-1">Voigt et al., 2018</a>), “50% of Bornean orang-utans were 
		affected by natural resource extraction” and also that “100,000 Bornean orangutans were lost between 1999 and 2015” 
		(<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30086-1">Voigt et al., 2018</a>). The study also importantly points out that many orangutangs are
		killed due to hunting which is a critical issue to be considered alongside palm oil deforestation. </p>

		<h3 style=color:#2e69c9><b>Elephants</b></h3>
		<br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout Southeast Asian countries where palm oil production rates are the highest
		in the world, rare breeds of elephants are suffering and at risk of extinction due to the processes 
		involved with the growth of palm oil. Aside from the effects of general deforestation and loss of 
		habitat, an unfortunate practice of palm oil workers poisoning elephants has been reported. The practice is 
		said to take place because "that's how the plantation workers stop the animals from eating the fruit 
		of the oil palm" (<a href=" https://www.rainforest-rescue.org/petitions/905/malaysia-pygmy-elephants-poisoned-for-palm-oil">Source</a>).</p>
		<br>
		<p>The following video from The Ecologist compliments the points made throughout this multimedia essay - reporting the 
		current landscape of how elephants are suffering in Indonesia due to palm oil production:</p>

		</center>
		<br>
		<p>As a result of the issues (such as deforestation, pest control, and loss of resources) associated with palm oil, the population
		of Asian elephants is rapidly declining. There are less than 3000 Sumatran elephants left in the world (<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/endangered-species-threatened-by-unsustainable-palm-oil-production">source</a>).
		Additionally, there are only approximately 1500 Bornean Pygmy Elephants left in the wild (<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/endangered-species-threatened-by-unsustainable-palm-oil-production">source</a>).
