		<h1 id="heading">What is Palm Oil?</h1>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palm oil, a derivative of the African oil palm plant, is the “world’s highest yielding and least expensive vegetable oil” (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159668">Vijay et al, 2016</a>) which 
		has led the oil to becoming a highly universal and popularly used commodity throughout the world. Towards the end of 2018 and into 2019, palm oil evolved
		into being an incredibly popular point of debate – with social media campaigns such as Iceland’s “<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdpspllWI2o">#NoPalmOilChristmas</a>’ advert going viral on social media 
		and on mainstream media. Despite palm oil recently gaining significant momentum and exposure throughout popular culture, the issue of palm oil is not a new 
		issue. Below is a video from the BBC which provides an introductory description into palm oil: </p>

		<p>Products have been adapted from the African oil plant for “thousands of years”, however, “in the last 50 years … there has been a phenomenal expansion 
		in its cultivation throughout the tropics, such that palm oil is now a major commodity of world trade, and oil palm is a leading source of vegetable oil” (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780981893693500046">Henson et al., 2012: 2</a>). 
		The rapid gain in popularity of the oil is fundamentally due to the benefit of palm oil being cheap, efficient, and a highly versatile oil – influencing the oil 
		to be found and used in thousands of products.</p>

		<h1 id="heading">Why is Palm Oil an Issue?</h1>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of palm oil is a significant moral issue due to the damage the production of the product has on the <a href="CarbonPollution.html">environment</a>, <a href="IndigineousPeople.html">local communities</a> and <a href="RareAnimalsDying.html">rare animals</a>. 
		Such damage associated with the growth of palm has led the oil to be named “cruel oil or green gold” as “the oil palm industry 
		(planting and milling) has a devastating impact on the environment and ecosystems” (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">Khatun et al., 2017: 608</a>).
		In short, the production of palm oil requires large amounts of land to be deforested – leading to habitat loss, conflict within indigenous 
		communities, death of rare animals, and carbon pollution due to ‘slash and burn’ deforestation techniques (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">Khatun et al., 2017: 608</a>). 
		The various ethical consequences associated with the production of palm oil are discussed in more detail throughout this essay, including - <a href="CarbonPollution.html">carbon pollution</a>, <a href="MassDeforestation.html">mass deforestation</a>,
		<a href="RareAnimalsDying.html">death of rare animals</a> and <a href="IndigineousPeople.html">loss of habitat for indigenous communities</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h1 id="heading">Where is Palm Oil Found?</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A factor that further fuels the severity of the use of palm oil is that it is a material 
		that is currently used in thousands of products worldwide – including food and drink, cosmetics, 
		fuel, and livestock feed. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Examples of global brands which use <b>unsustainable</b> palm oil include:</p>

		<br>
		<p>With unsustainable palm oil used by large companies which are in control of thousands of products 
		worldwide, the issue of palm oil is magnified. Further, consumers may not be aware of the companies 
		that use unsustainable palm oil and are contributing to the environmental damage.</p>
		<br>
		As palm oil is a main component to so many products, it is practically impossible to completely avoid buying 
		palm oil (advice on what you can do is found <a href="WhatCanYouDoToHelp.html">here</a>). 
		Further, the production of palm oil only continues to increase. As discussed by (<a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/science/article/pii/S1364032117304203">Khatun et al., 2017: 608</a>) – “global palm oil 
		production has doubled every 10 years in the past few decades. By 2020, the production is expected to reach 78 million tons.”</p>

		<h1 id="heading">Aim of this Multimedia Essay</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This multimedia essay aims to serve as a platform to provide information to consumers 
		in an interactive, multimedia format. By doing so, this multimedia essay hopes to provide 
		users with the information they need to be able to make a decision on how to best proceed 
		with their consumer habits. If we all begin to incorporate products that contain sustainable
		palm oil into our lifestyles, there is a magnificent scope and potential for working towards 
		resolving the issues caused by palm oil production and deforestation. </p>
